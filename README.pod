STEREO-pipeline -- post-processing for STEREO/SECCHI

=head1 OVERVIEW

This is a collection of routines that comprise a STEREO spacecraft post-processing pipeline,
to model (and remove) background sources from the STEREO heliospheric imaging data.  It is 
kept as a collection of AutoLoader files in part because that style of development has become
the norm in the solar physics community due to the widespread adoption of SolarSoft
(http://ssw.lmsal.com), and in part because some of the tools are general-purpose enough that
hiding them in a module could be counterproductive.

The routines accept Level 1 (photometrically calibrated) data from the STEREO/SECCHI instruments
and extract from them a background model that is then subtracted and discarded.  They produce
Thomson-scattered images of the transient solar wind and transient features within it. Typical 
background rejection is 10^3-10^4.  In the case of data from STEREO-A HI-2, this means that 
output noise levels are within a factor of ~3 of the photon noise floor of the data.

The routines generally manipulate I<batches> of data, because spatiotemporal differences between 
the individual images are used to separate background from desired features.

=head1 LIMITATIONS

As of Winter 2013, the pipeline has been tested on HI-1A and HI-2A data.  It is likely to work
on HI-1B data (and testing will proceed in Spring 2013) but
