STEREO-pipeline -- post-processing for STEREO/SECCHI

=head1 OVERVIEW

This is a collection of routines that comprise a STEREO spacecraft post-processing pipeline,
to model (and remove) background sources from the STEREO heliospheric imaging data.  It is 
kept as a collection of AutoLoader files in part because that style of development has become
the norm in the solar physics community due to the widespread adoption of SolarSoft
(http://ssw.lmsal.com), and in part because some of the tools are general-purpose enough that
hiding them in a module could be counterproductive.

The routines accept Level 1 (photometrically calibrated) data from the STEREO/SECCHI instruments
and extract from them a background model that is then subtracted and discarded.  They produce
Thomson-scattered images of the transient solar wind and transient features within it. Typical 
background rejection is 10^3-10^4.  In the case of data from STEREO-A HI-2, this means that 
output noise levels are within a factor of ~3 of the photon noise floor of the data.

The routines generally manipulate I<batches> of data, because spatiotemporal differences between 
the individual images are used to separate background from desired features.

=head1 LIMITATIONS

As of Winter 2013, the pipeline has been tested on HI-1A and HI-2A data.  It is likely to work
on HI-1B data (and testing will proceed in Spring 2013) but will not work without modification 
on HI-2B data due to the different focus characteristics of that instrument.

The final data product represents photometric I<excess brightness> of I<moving objects> only:
as with an unpolarized coronagraph, it is not possible to separate the steady F coronal background
from a hypothetical steady K coronal component -- and therefore the brightness in the output 
.FITS files represents only excess brightness above a quasi-steady background level that contains
both F and some K.  For certain bright features (e.g. coronal mass ejections or corotating 
interaction regions in the solar wind) the background is negligible; for others (e.g. small
"puffs" or plasmoids in the solar wind) it is not.  The amplitude of bright features is 
photometrically correct to within the limits of the instrument photometric calculation and may
be used to calculate, e.g., excess electron surface densities or variations therein - but, for 
example, the brightnesses of two faint features separated by more than a few days in time may not be 
compared meaningfully and directly.

The background-subtracted images also contain many artifacts, and the user is warned to watch
for them.  In particular:
  
=over 3

=item * Stellar "telegraph" print-through

Pointlike sources undergo small fluctuations in apparent brightness as they cross the pixel grid.
This effect is suppressed for faint stars, but bright stars' and planets' apparent brightness
fluctuates enough (in an absolute sense) to remain once the primary bright point of the planet is
removed.

=item * Fourier motion-filter artifacts

Venus and Mercury can, at certain phases, produce long-lasting artifacts that extend through space
and time.  The artifacts can include converging and/or diverging motions or persistent bright spots.
The artifacts are visually recognizable and should be avoided.

Dust events from the spacecraft can produce single-frame bright streaks or several-frame bright
points.  Data dropouts produce single-frame black rectangles.  Both types of event are amplified 
by the Fourier motion filter, and can extend through several frames.  These artifacts are recognizable
and should be avoided.

In HI-2A images, the Earth occulter at the left side of the frame can contain strangely moving artifacts.
These are not masked out, but should be ignored.

=item * Starfield motion artifacts

The pipeline relies on steady orbital motion and pointing from the spacecraft, to identify the starfield.
It attempts to recognize and avoid pointing shifts such as the occasional roll maneuvers, but can be fooled
by the occasional pointing excursions that are seen throughout the mission.  When small, these excursions
are compensated by the pipeline - but when large, they cause persistent starfield-like artifacts that last
for one batch time (7 days).
